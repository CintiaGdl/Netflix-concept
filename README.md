- Clicking on the poster to see all available trailers from youtube.

## Libraries üìö

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) because is a library we can use for client and server side.

- [Glider](https://github.com/kevinfarrugia/react-glider) implementing a slider could be time consuming and costumization wasn't a requirement.

    - Sourcemap, glider throws a warning in development environment so I have to disable sourcemap in [.env](.env)

- [React-router-dom](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) for page routing.

- [React-player](https://github.com/CookPete/react-player) to display youtube videos for the trailers 

- [React-burger-menu](https://github.com/negomi/react-burger-menu) to create a burger menu for responsive view

## Improvements, todos, next iterations ü§ì

- Home page show another slider with with suggested movies for the user using the endpoints available from API (get recommendations, get similar movies).

- Modal to display more information about the movies. With the requests we are getting rich information about each movie (overview, genre, rating,..) we could render it in a pop up.

- My list page to save your favorite movies and
show related content with these, using the the [API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/4/list/create-list)

- Profile with user information as proof of concept using a local storage instead create a database.
